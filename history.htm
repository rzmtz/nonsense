            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5px">BYFS started as an idea in the head of pioneer 
                George Washington, who saw so many companies that had great ideas but struggled to get 
                them into the market and in the hands of customers. As George spoke with more people 
                about the issues they faced, it seemed as thoguh everything centered around 3 core
                areas: getting the idea to market, having the right messsages to describe it, and 
                foundational leadership to sustain momentum.</p>
            <br/>
            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5px"> George opened BYFS in 1997 out of his garage, 
                With $500 and a single client. Today, BYFS services over 100 clients across the United
                States and Europe, and employs more than 20 consultants and mentors. </p>
            <br/>
            <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 5px"> BYFS is located in sunny Seattle, Washington,
                and is making plans for a London office in the near future. Feel free to
